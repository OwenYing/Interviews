Why Bloomberg?
-----------------------
1. Strong foundation of data, support exciting projects. And I can solve the 
real-world problem using the data and resources. It feels great.
The projects can be landed in real world, supported by Bloomberg with strong foudation,
with good resources. Impact thoudsands of people. If I remember right, there are 
about 325,000 top business and decision makers.

2. Bloomberg has very strong impact in the world, it must be really cool expecting
my team's project being landed. I am passion at the technologies and want to make 
an impact.

3. I know there is a training program before get into work, through that I think 
I can learn the technology stack as well as know new friends. The smooth of the 
process really attract me a lot.

4. In Bloomberg, I can learn the standard of how to program and how to collaborate.
I can learn the whole process from writing codes to finally publish the application.

5. I can learn a lot from Bloomberg and grows very fast. 
Also I have engineering background as well as machine learning background,
I think in Bloomberg I can combine them together to make max profit. 

6. Most of the people I work with are super talented and extremely intelligent.
Can make different friends and get to know different cultures. As I know there
is no offices in Bloomberg, which I think is a perfect idea, in this case 
people can communicate more and learn more from others.

7. Bloomberg University can help me keep learning, keep improve myself and even
learn something totally not in my field, like finance. 
The health and wellness are good, which covers most healthy issues, this is 
important for me since with this you can totally go to work without any worries.

7. The terminal is sooo cool. I can feel the high techs even I don't know how 
it is implemented.  And it's New York! It's soo cool working here.

8. I have a faverable impression on Bloomberg, since every time on career, Bloombergs'
people are friendly and the gifts are the best, hhhhhh
I might be able to work in different offices among the world, which is attractive.
Also I love to be a volenteer and help the community, to step out of the office
and help people in person.
I am a keyboard fan and I was so excited seeing the Bloomberg keyboard.
I watch Bloomberg Technology very often, to get to know the up-to-date news 
in technology.
