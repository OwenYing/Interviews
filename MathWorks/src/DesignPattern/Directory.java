/*
1. Abstract Factory -- Factory Maker
2. Factory Method -- defer init to subclass
3. Builder -- help to semantic constructor
4. Facade -- provide easier surface of operating underneath complex operation
5. Adapter -- for interface1 to fit interface2 ( implements interface2, while having interface1's instance)
6. Decorator -- Wrap the original one with armor ; both implements the same interface
7. Bridge -- Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
8. Chain of Responsibility -- Pass the request along a linked list, if this node can handle it, then handle it. Or not, pass to the next node.
