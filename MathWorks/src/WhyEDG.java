Why EDG?
    1. Help me transfer my knowledge from school to real world
    2. I can interact with real users to know their needs, along the way I can practice communicating with people
    3. Solve real world problem
    4. Learn lots of new knowledge and try every direction before jumping
        into a specific team.
    5. I will learn to use Matlab and Simulink taught by experts, and in the
        future I can use Matlab to conduct amazing researches
    6. I can work with really smart people from all around the world, working
        with amazing people makes you improve faster.
    7. I can keep learning, add skills to my skill set and make myself more
        competitive.

Why Fit?
    1. My field now is Web Application development, which uses OOD a lot.
        So I have strong foundation of OOD.
    2. I am developing a full stack Web App all by myself, including front-end
        and back-end. So I have foundation in both front-end and back-end, which makes
        me easy to fit into wider range of projects.
    3. I also have machine learning background, maybe in the future those knowledge
        might works.
    4. I love to communicate with people, and get to know what users requirement.
        I'd love to help them with their real world problems.
    5. And I'm eager to learn new things, the SlidesController project on my resume,
        I used ten day developed it with no Android knowledge at the beginning.
