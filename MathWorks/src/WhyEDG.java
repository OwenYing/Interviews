Why EDG?
    1. Help me transfer my knowledge from school to real world
    2. I can interact with real users to know their needs, along the way I can practice communicating with people
    3. Solve real world problem
    4. Learn lots of new knowledge and try every direction before jumping
        into a specific team. I have chances to try projects in different fields.
    5. I will learn to use Matlab and Simulink taught by experts, and in the
        future I can use Matlab to conduct amazing researches
    6. I can work with really smart people from all around the world, working
        with amazing people makes you improve faster.
    7. I can keep learning, add skills to my skill set and make myself more
        competitive.
    8. Mathworks have really attractive benefits, with which working for Mathworks doesn't need to worry about other things,
        can put full heart into work.
    9. Matlab is one of the best research and design tools used by millions researchers, it is super cool to participate
        into this and contribute to researches.
    10. I can learn developing software in a more systematic way, from requirement to publish.
    11. I can learn from the training programs, since Mathworks provides many training sessions, it shows the caring about
        company's improvement and its employee's improvement, which is valuable.
    12. The Big Picture Orientation attracts me a lot, with this you can clearly understand how the company works to
        how to master the detailed techs, which can be super helpful for new grads to transfer our knowledge from school
        to industry.

    Summary:
        1. school --> industry
        2. solve real world problem
        3. real users, communicate skill
        4. help researchers
        5. learn Matlab + Simulink, build my skill set
        6. work with smart people
        7. benefits
        8. try different direction
        9. learn developing in a systematic way
        10. Continue learning, company and employee's improvement
        11. Big Picture Orientation --> how the company works
        12. Individual Office


Why Fit?
    1. My field now is Web Application development, which uses OOD a lot.
        So I have strong foundation of OOD.
    2. I am developing a full stack Web App all by myself, including front-end
        and back-end. So I have foundation in both front-end and back-end, which makes
        me easy to fit into wider range of projects.
    3. I also have machine learning background, maybe in the future those knowledge
        might works.
    4. I love to communicate with people, and get to know what users requirement.
        I'd love to help them with their real world problems.
    5. And I'm eager to learn new things, the SlidesController project on my resume,
        I used ten day developed it with no Android knowledge at the beginning.

    Summary:
        1. Cloud Software --> OOD
        2. Full stack --> front-end & back-end
        3. Machine Learning --> fit the company
        4. Love communication
        5. Fast and eager learner --> story: slides controller + how to get TA position
